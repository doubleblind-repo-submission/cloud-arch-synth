I enjoyed participating in the classroom activity.;The classroom activity was interesting and held my attention.;I felt motivated to participate actively in my group.;The activity helped me better understand the concepts of distributed architectures.;The practical exercise was more useful than just reviewing theory.;I would like this type of activity to be included regularly throughout the semester. ;I can apply what I learned in this activity in academic or professional projects. ;Designing the architecture helped me connect theory with real-world use cases.;The instructions were clear and easy to follow.;The support material (cheat sheet, guide) was useful for completing the activity.;The time we allotted for the classroom activity was adequate. ;The group work helped me learn from my classmates.;The exchange of ideas between teams was valuable for enriching my proposal. ;What did you like most about the classroom activity? ;What would you improve for future editions?
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;The freedom to work, while still having the professor’s support.;"I would improve the time aspect a bit; it was somewhat lacking."
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;Being able to share ideas with my classmates and the professor, and see different perspectives on how to design the architecture type.;A bit more time for the classroom activity.
5;5;5;4;4;4;5;5;4;3;3;4;4;Applying what we learned during the semester, using different architectures and learning new ones. This way I can replicate how to create a real architecture.;Doing a real hands-on practice where we have to build our own AWS architecture.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The methodology.;An asynchronous refresher/background on key concepts before the classroom activity.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;Being able to create an architecture with my partner and learn what steps I should follow before continuing to add or remove services.;Maybe start the activity earlier, since I arrived late to my next class.
4;4;5;3;5;5;4;4;5;5;1;3;3;The opportunity to use our own design, with a few modifications to an existing design.;The time to complete the activity—I don’t know if it was due to the class or what happened, but having only 20 minutes for the last part of the activity felt like too little.
3;4;5;3;4;4;5;4;5;5;2;5;5;What I liked most about the classroom activity is that it was a group activity, different from what we usually do. I also liked applying architectures in that way without using an AWS course lab.;"Consider class time, since there wasn’t enough time left because topics were explained at the beginning and we couldn’t do it more calmly; so reducing either the classroom activity scope/time or the theoretical class time should be considered."
4;4;4;3;3;4;4;3;3;4;3;5;5;Having all services available and trying to solve and structure a good architecture so that it is logical and optimal.;A prior video to better relate/connect the topics.
5;5;5;4;5;5;5;5;3;4;4;4;4;Practicing the theory with real architectures.;Greater clarity in the classroom activity instructions.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;I liked that we were given a sheet with examples/cases to guide me during the activity.;The distribution of class time and practice could be planned better, since the classroom activity ran a bit over the class hour.
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;What I liked was that everyone had something different in their architecture, meaning there was no defined path, and it even gave us the chance to create our own architecture.;I would make the classroom activity time longer.
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;2;4;4;I liked working as a team because I could exchange ideas and learn things I didn’t know. Also, having the possibility to do some research.;Extend the time to complete the activity.
5;5;4;4;4;5;4;4;5;4;5;4;4;Part of the architecture to be designed had already been learned and done in previous labs, so it was more intuitive to apply it again in new contexts.;Better emphasize which services we will be given/allowed to use to design an architecture, and allow using the ones we already know.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;Applying and illustrating the content at that moment reinforces it and allows us to question what was understood exactly.;Vary the scope or content of the activities.
5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;3;4;4;4;5;The most valuable part was the challenge of turning theoretical concepts into a tangible structure, especially when debating whether Edge latency or HPC computing power fit the diagram better. Working in pairs allowed us to contrast ideas about service scalability, resulting in a final architecture that was much more robust and coherent than what we would have designed individually.;Ideally, there would be a brief technical simulation phase where we could test how the chosen architecture reacts to a critical node failure. Also, adding a quick comparison of operating costs between the mixed option and the “pure” options would add much-needed business realism to complement the system’s logical design.
4;5;4;4;5;5;5;5;4;5;1;5;5;The explanations of concepts and the teamwork.;That they be done more often.
5;5;4;5;4;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;4;I liked applying the knowledge acquired.;More time to complete the classroom activity.
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;3;4;4;Designing modern systems using new tools.;Better feedback.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;It was a dynamic and practical way to learn the topic.;Provide feedback after grading.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Designing an architecture that could be applied to a real-life system.;I would have liked the architecture design not to be left so open and up to our decision, but to be more specific.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;4;3;5;5;Being able to discuss the use of different AWS tools.;More time for the activity.
2;3;4;3;2;1;3;3;1;3;1;1;1;The way it was set up, since there were many system types that could be created with the services provided.;More time could help analyze each service better in order to propose a good system.
5;5;5;4;5;4;4;3;4;5;1;5;4;Interacting with classmates more to reach a solution together.;More time for the practical part.
5;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;Many of the topics covered in class were put into practice, which helped us understand everything better.;Allow more time to carry out this classroom activity.
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;3;4;4;The examples.;More time for the classroom activity.
5;5;5;5;5;5;3;5;5;5;1;5;5;Designing the type of architecture that, for us, was the most efficient for the system.;Add more time to the classroom activity to ask more questions and get more solid feedback.
4;3;4;4;3;3;4;4;4;4;2;3;3;Starting from real-world cases.;Review/give feedback on the answers in class.
3;5;5;3;4;5;5;3;4;5;2;4;5;The freedom to propose the best-fitting solution, and the use of AI tools that allowed the activity to run smoothly.;It might be interesting to tell students which architecture to build (but not how), and see how creative or efficient their solutions are.
5;5;5;5;4;5;4;5;5;5;4;5;5;The interactivity with the instructor.;Nothing, everything was very good.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Creating a distributed system diagram.;Run other similar classroom activitys to become more familiar with this type of exercise.
5;4;4;4;4;4;5;4;4;5;3;4;4;Working in pairs, because we could exchange ideas and knowledge to fill gaps I had about certain parts of the topic, and apply distributed-architecture concepts in practice.;More time to explain the examples and resolve questions.
5;5;5;5;5;5;4;3;5;5;4;4;4;Learning how cloud architectures are built in a real case.;There wasn’t enough time to complete the classroom activity activity itself.
4;4;4;3;5;5;5;5;2;4;1;5;5;Having the list of cloud services available to plan our architecture in a simple graph.;The time and the instructions. It was a bit confusing at first between the base architecture and the “improved” one.
5;5;5;5;4;4;5;5;3;5;2;3;4;Being able to define the necessary components of the architecture design and understand what benefit each one provides. Also, comparing with real company cases helps you see how frequently they are used, and that you can dare to propose solutions that can reach that level.;Organize the groups in advance.
3;4;2;4;4;4;5;5;4;4;2;3;3;Learning to organize the flow of an AWS architecture.;A bit more time to finish.
4;4;5;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;3;4;4;Proposing a use case and its architecture using the tools we were assigned.;That it be done via a virtual classroom.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;3;5;5;I liked that we had to do a small preliminary investigation before starting the classroom activity, to understand what we had to build and how to explain it.;Add more design examples covering different areas (Edge, HPC, mixed).
5;4;4;3;5;5;5;2;5;3;3;5;5;Cheat sheet.;I really don’t know.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;4;4;Applying different services and alternatives to the services that would be considered “the standard/default choice.”;It’s fine now.
5;4;4;4;4;4;5;4;5;5;4;3;3;Applying the theory we learned in a practical example, and the freedom we had to propose a system based on the resources we had.;Maybe more time for the activity, and not combining the courses—or having both professors present—to provide more instructor support.
5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;3;5;2;3;1;“First, working in pairs makes it easier to do the work and exchange ideas. I also liked that the classroom activity came with the help sheet and example cases.”;Run the classroom activity a bit earlier since it ended after class time.
4;4;5;5;3;4;5;3;4;4;4;3;4;It was quick and concise.;That the class not be at 7 a.m.
4;3;3;5;5;2;4;4;4;5;2;4;4;I liked how clear the instructions were, complemented by the guiding examples and the cheat sheet.;It could be useful to leave time at the end for each group to briefly present their architecture and receive feedback. Also, we could go a bit deeper into defining metrics and how to justify them depending on the architecture type.
5;5;5;4;3;5;4;3;5;5;3;4;4;The practical part.;Consider the number of students who attend.
4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;I liked interacting during class instead of just listening.;The activity time.
5;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;4;4;5;5;5;We could learn how the architectures of some well-known companies are structured and what each AWS service they use is for.;I feel that even though the examples were good for understanding the topic, an extra topic wouldn’t have been bad.
4;5;4;4;5;4;4;4;4;3;4;4;4;It was concise.;That there be more time.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The excellent explanation and guidance/support.;That more time be given.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;;Más tiempo
