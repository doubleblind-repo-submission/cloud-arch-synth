I enjoyed participating in the workshop.;The workshop was interesting and kept my attention.;I felt motivated to actively participate in my group.;The workshop helped me better understand the concepts of distributed architectures (Edge, HPC, Mixed).;The practical exercise was more useful than just reviewing theory.;I'd like these types of activities to be included regularly throughout the semester.;What you learn in this workshop can be applied to academic or professional projects.;Designing synthetic architectures helped me relate theory to real-life situations.;The instructions were clear and easy to follow.;The support material (cheat sheet and question guide) was useful for carrying out the activity.;The time allocated to the workshop was adequate.;Group work helped me learn from my classmates.;The exchange of ideas between teams was valuable in enriching my proposal.;What did you like most about the workshop?;What would you improve for future editions?
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Learn how to link more AWS services; A couple more examples
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The practical activity;More class time
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5; The simplicity of the teaching, since it did not mix content and was made easy to understand; Nothing
4;5;4;4;3;4;4;4;3;5;5;5;5;The explanation of the workshop theory;Nothing for the moment.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Share ideas with my partner to find an optimal solution.;Explanation of a case prior to performing the exercise.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5; The practical exercise seemed very interesting to me as each group has a different case.;Nothing, everything seemed fine to me
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;That the teacher explains very well;May it last longer ??
4;4;5;3;4;5;4;3;5;5;5;5;5; I enjoyed learning about AWS services.;think focusing on tools isn't the best strategy. I think the problem should be presented first, and then the student should figure out how to solve it.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5; I explain 3 important concepts in a simple and clear way; It was ok
5;4;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5; All; The time.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The power to practice to build our architecture;Nothing, I liked how dynamic and practical it was.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5; The explanation of the examples of each architecture; Have more time for explanations
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;4;5;4;5;I was unaware of this type of architecture, I had the notion but not the full capacity of these concepts.;More features or slightly more rigorous methodologies (more detailed examples made by students)
5;5;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;4;4;4;4;The practical part of thinking/creating an architecture based on X services;More activities, maybe direct labs in AWS
4;5;4;5;4;5;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;Learn new concepts;Using the architecture directly in AWS
4;4;3;4;4;5;4;4;3;4;2;3;4;How real-life use was explained, companies like 3M;A little more time or restructure the way this is distributed
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;That made us think about how to improve a system based on the context we assume.;The workshop should not only be for couples but also for groups of up to 4 students.
5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;4;4;4;The dynamism and practice of the theory seen further reinforces the acquired knowledge;Let there be more time
