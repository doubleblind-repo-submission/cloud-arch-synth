I enjoyed participating in the classroom activity.;The classroom activity was interesting and held my attention.;I felt motivated to participate actively in my group.;The activity helped me better understand the concepts of distributed architectures.;The practical exercise was more useful than just reviewing theory.;I would like this type of activity to be included regularly throughout the semester. ;I can apply what I learned in this activity in academic or professional projects. ;Designing the architecture helped me connect theory with real-world use cases.;The instructions were clear and easy to follow.;The support material (cheat sheet, guide) was useful for completing the activity.;The time we allotted for the classroom activity was adequate. ;The group work helped me learn from my classmates.;The exchange of ideas between teams was valuable for enriching my proposal. ;What did you like most about the classroom activity? ;What would you improve for future editions?
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Learning how to connect/link more AWS services.;A couple more examples.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The hands-on activity.;More class time.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The simplicity of the teaching, since it didn’t mix content and was easy to understand.;Nothing.
4;5;4;4;3;4;4;4;3;5;5;5;5;The explanation of the classroom activity’s theory.;Nothing for now.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Sharing ideas with my partner to find an optimal solution.;Explaining a case before doing the exercise.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;I found the practical exercise very interesting because each group had a different case.;"Nothing; everything seemed fine to me."
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The professor explains very well.;That it lasts longer 😁
4;4;5;3;4;5;4;3;5;5;5;5;5;I liked learning about AWS services.;I don’t think focusing on the tools is the best strategy. I think the problem should be presented first, and then the student should look for a way to solve it. Not give a list and try to fit into it, because that doesn’t seem realistic to me.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;They explained three important concepts in a simple and clear way.;It was good.
5;4;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Everything.;The time.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Being able to practice building our architecture.;"Nothing; I liked how dynamic and practical it was."
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The explanation of the examples for each architecture.;Have more time for explanations.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;4;5;4;5;"I didn’t know this type of architecture; I had a general idea, but not a full grasp of these concepts.";More features or somewhat more rigorous methodologies (more detailed examples done by the students).
5;5;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;4;4;4;4;The practical part of thinking/creating an architecture having certain (given) services as a base.;More activities, maybe hands-on practice directly in AWS.
4;5;4;5;4;5;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;Learning new concepts.;Using the architecture directly in AWS.
4;4;3;4;4;5;4;4;3;4;2;3;4;How real-life use was explained, with companies like 3M as examples.;A bit more time, or restructure how it is allocated/distributed.
5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;It made us think about how to improve a system based on the context we assumed.;That the classroom activity not be only in pairs, but in groups of up to 4 students.
5;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;4;4;4;The dynamism and practicing the theory we saw reinforces the knowledge acquired even more.;That there be more time.
