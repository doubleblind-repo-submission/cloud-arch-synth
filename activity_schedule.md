# Time Allocation and Checkpoints for the Classroom Activity (120 minutes)

## Time allocation (2 hours total)

- **0:00–0:20 (20 min)** — Explanation of *Edge vs. HPC* + instructions and expected deliverables  
- **0:20–0:50 (30 min)** — Flow diagram (architecture workflow)  
- **0:50–1:10 (20 min)** — **Question 1:** Added/removed services  
- **1:10–1:30 (20 min)** — **Question 2:** Design assumptions  
- **1:30–1:50 (20 min)** — **Question 3:** Validations and metrics  
- **1:50–2:00 (10 min)** — Final review + submission  

---

## Activity-wide checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1 — **0:35**  
*(15 minutes into the Flow diagram block)*

**Minimum expected progress:**
- A draft baseline flow (**end-to-end**) with clear arrows:  
  **input → processing → storage/output**

---

### Checkpoint 2 — **1:35**  
*(5 minutes into the Validations and metrics block)*

**Minimum expected progress:**
- **Question 1** completed (written response).  
- **Question 2** completed (written response).  
- In **Question 3**, at least **one** validation/metric already defined (teams should still need to define the second, but they must have started).

**Instructor prompt if teams are behind:**
- *“If you are not working on Question 3 yet, please wrap up now and move to metrics.”*

## Closing checkpoint (last 10 minutes)

During **1:50–2:00**, the instructor performs a quick whole-class check:

- Does the flow diagram reflect the changes proposed in **Q1**?  
- Do the assumptions stated in **Q2** support the final design?  
- Does **Q3** include at least **two** validation items/metrics?
