# Evaluation Rubric used in the activity

| **Criterion** | **Description** | **Points** |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **Active individual participation** | The student engages in the activity, proposes ideas, and contributes to the architecture design. Initiative and willingness beyond technical correction are valued. | 15 |
| **Collaboration and idea exchange** | Debate within the team and, if possible, between teams is encouraged. The ability to engage in dialogue, compare proposals, and justify decisions is valued. | 20 |
| **Justification of architectural changes** | Clearly explains the services added and/or removed, demonstrating an understanding of the role they play in a distributed system. | 20 |
| **Design assumptions** | Poses coherent conditions that support the architecture (e.g., processing in Edge vs. HPC, batch or stream communication, storage). | 20 |
| **Proposal of validations/metrics** | Suggests criteria to evaluate the design (latency, throughput, scalability, fault tolerance). The ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical, testable ones is valued. | 15 |
| **Clarity and organization of the deliverable** | The diagram is legible and the written explanation is well structured, facilitating the understanding of the proposed design. | 10 |
| **Total** |  | **100** |
